  <h1 class="custom-font-1">Welcome to Tom Pasini. Your search for enlightenment has ended.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>I'm just kidding. I just felt like a h1 heading deserved some epic text with it. A p tag can be a little more subdued. I like to joke.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in marketing. Although I don't use that degree at all today, I am very grateful for the experiences college gave me.</p>

    

    <p>I used to work at Paylocity before I came here. I was working in the Techincal Support department before I left, assisting the internal employees with various needs. It was there that I learned the basics of SQL. I wouldn't have considered software development as a career path had I not been forced to dive in and get my feet wet with SQL. I gained the confidence I needed to determine this is something I can do. It's a very fun language, and I'm excited to get reacquainted with it later in this course.</p>
